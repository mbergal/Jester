Jester
======

Another BDD framework for PowerShell. It's a bit of a cross between Pester, Jasmine and RSpec.

It's different from Pester in several aspects:

* Supports Before/After.
* Matchers implementation is different.
* Allows to select tests for execution.

Currently it does not support at least the following Pester features:

* Mocks
* NUnit result output
